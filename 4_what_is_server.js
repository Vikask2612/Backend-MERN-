What is a Server in Coding? (Simple Explanation)

In coding, a server is a program or computer that listens for requests from 
clients (like web browsers or mobile apps) and sends back responses.


---

âœ… Example:

You open a website like www.google.com in your browser (client).

Your browser sends a request to Google's server.

The server checks what you asked for.

It sends back the web page (response) to your browser.

ðŸ”„ How it works (Real-Life Example):

Think of it like a restaurant:

You (Client) ask the waiter (Request) for food.

The kitchen (Server) prepares the food.

The waiter brings your order back (Response).

ðŸ’¡ In Code:

In Node.js, you can create a simple server like this:

const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from the server!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

ðŸ“Œ This code:

Creates a server.  

Listens on port 3000.

Responds with "Hello from the server!" when accessed.
